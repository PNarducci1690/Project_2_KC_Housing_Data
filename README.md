# Module 2 Final Project - King County House Sales


## Introduction

This project takes a look at the King County House Sales dataset in order to project the cost of homes in King County, Washington. According to research from the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/news/2020/10/15/for-single-adults-and-families-alike-higher-cost-of-living-in-all-washington-counties/), King County is the most expensive area to live in, in terms of cost of living, in Washington state. It is projected that an adult living in King County would need to make at least $44,000 a year in order to get by. The cost of living, however, could double or triple for single parents and multi-family homes. On average, an adult needs to make $17.61 per hour in order to get by. This is alarming, but also not the main objective of this project.

My project is meant to be used as a resource for those seeking to buy a home in King County. The project takes a look at what features directly affect the cost of a home, and projects where the most affordable homes are located within the county. This dataset can be used by low to middle class families seeking to begin a life in King County, or by those seeking to make a profit by flipping a home. In essence, this project is a guide for the home buyer as they naviagte the housing market that is King County. 

This project focuses on three factors in order to determine the cost of living in King's County:
    1. How the location of a home affects it's value.
    1. How the physical attributes of a home (i.e. condition, number of floors, number of bedrooms, etc.) affect the value of the home.
    1. How external factors (i.e. neighbors, grade, year home was built, etc.) where the home is located affect the value of the home.
Using these factors as a basis, families can determine what homes are best suited to their needs.

## Findings

### Location

According to the data, home location has an impact on the price of the home. Homes located in areas such as Seattle, Merer Island, Bellevue, and the surrounding areas are very expensive (in the millions) and would be out of the price range of families seeking affordable homes. Families seeking affordable housing should look towards the southern half of the county, such as Mapple Valley, Hobart, Black Diamond, and southern Seattle. The homes in this area generally cost between a mean price between 230K and 400K, making them affordable for home buyers seeking to start a family in the county. However, majority of these homes are outside of the major city areas, meaning that most home owners will need to commute to work. The maps bellow show the prices of the homes by zipcode and by latitude and longitude loaction.
